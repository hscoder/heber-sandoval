Hi, I'm Héber Sandoval, currently a Learn-Verified student at the [Flatiron School](https://learn.co).

## Introduction

It is exciting to see a masterpiece being birth from a simple idea to a full featured application. Getting intimate with all its working parts, creates a special bond between code and artist. Through much practice, I hope to contribute a small paint stroke, so to speak, among lots of beautiful art work out there.
