I started to learn Full Stack Web Development back in December 2015 with the Flatiron's School online course. Learn.co focuses on teaching students the Ruby language, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Git and GitHub among other technologies.

The objective of my blog, is to write about what I'm learning. As they say, "Repetition is the mother of Retention". So, in hopes to cement these concepts and become second nature, I will be posting the progress of my journey.
